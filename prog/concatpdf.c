/*
 * concatpdf.c
 *
 *    This program concatenates all pdfs in a directory by rendering them
 *    as images, optionally scaling the images, and generating an output pdf.
 *    The pdfs are taken in lexical order.  It chooses the same encoding
 *    for all pages, which is either tiffg4 or jpeg (DCT).  For the latter,
 *    the jpeg quality factor can be used to trade off the size of the
 *    resulting pdf against the image quality.
 *
 *    If the pages are monochrome (black and white), use of the %one-bit
 *    flag will achieve better compression with less distortion.
 *    If most of the pages are black and white, but some have color that
 *    needs to be saved, input parameters %one_bit and %save_color should
 *    be both set to 1.  Then the pages with color are compressed with DCT
 *    and the monochrome pages are compressed with tiffg4.
 *
 *    The first step is to render the images as RGB, using Poppler's pdftoppm.
 *    Compare concatpdf with cleanpdf, which carries out several cleanup
 *    operations, such as deskewing and adaptive thresholding to clean
 *    noisy or dark backgrounds in grayscale or color images, which results
 *    in high resolution, 1 bpp tiffg4 encoded images in the pdf.
 *
 *      Syntax:
 *       concatpdf basedir scalefactor one_bit save_color quality title outfile
 *
 *    The %basedir is a directory where the input pdf files are located.
 *    The program will operate on every file in this directory with
 *    the ".pdf" extension.
 *
 *    The %scalefactor is typically used to downscale the image to
 *    reduce the size of the generated pdf.  It should not affect the
 *    pdf display otherwise.  For normal text on images scanned at 300 ppi,
 *    a 2x reduction (%scalefactor = 0.5) may be satisfactory.
 *    We compute an output resolution for that pdf that will cause it
 *    to print 11 inches high, based on the height in pixels of the
 *    first image in the set.
 *
 *    Images are saved in the ./image directory as RGB in ppm format.
 *    If the %one_bit flag is 0, these will be encoded in the output pdf
 *    using DCT.  To force the images to be 1 bpp, with tiffg4 encoding, set
 *    the $one-bit flag to 1.
 *
 *    The %save_color flag is ignored unless %one_bit is 1.  In that case,
 *    if %save_color is 1, the image is tested for color content, and if
 *    even a relatively small amount is found, the image will be encoded
 *    with DCT instead of tiffg4.
 *
 *    The %quality is the jpeg output quality factor for images stored
 *    in the pdf.  Use 0 for the default value (50), which is satisfactory
 *    for many purposes.  Use 75 for standard jpeq quality; 85-95 are very
 *    high quality.  Allowed values are between 25 and 95.
 *
 *    The %title is the title given to the pdf.  Use %title == "none"
 *    to omit the title.
 *
 *    The pdf output is written to %outfile.  It is advisable (but not
 *    required) to have a '.pdf' extension.
 *
 *    N.B.  This requires the Poppler package of pdf utilities, such as
 *          pdfimages and pdftoppm.  For non-unix systems, this requires
 *          installation of the cygwin Poppler package:
 *       https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=x86/poppler/
 *              poppler-0.26.5-1
